NEKTARIOS:

SOURCE CODE:
planeFitter,
visualizations ( to VRML and images)
BundleOptimizer: framework setup, normal BA, pairwise BA. 
latticeDetector: isPointValid, isIntegerCombination, calculateFinalBasisVectors

REPORT writing:
Results & Discussion, Conclusion


ROMY:

SOURCE CODE:
latticeDetector: all methods except the three of Nektarios
BundleOptimizer: adjustment of everything to support lattice consolidation (incorporation of additional error term, change of setup if rigid is chosen, support for necessary basis vector transformations), cost calculations
latticeClass: load to/from file, lattice consolidation and therefore necessary basis vector transformation framework
