# 3DVisionProject

## running project
- Clone the project to a local folder. `git clone https://github.com/ryenelith/3DVisionProject localDirectory/`
- Open command window and navigate to project folder.
- Manually edit the path to the cam and points files (sorry, didn't work using local paths for me) 
- make the project by running the makefile using `make`
- run project using `./3DVisionProject`

Hope you get it working.
